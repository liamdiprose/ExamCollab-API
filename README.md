# ExamCollab-API
The backend API for examcollab

## Motivation
The university I study at release previous exam papers as study material for students, however, the answers are not released. Students started sharing answers online with Google Docs. This works well, but often the medium is abused (off topic discussions, delete the whole document, etc).
This project aims to provide a much more suitable platform to share exam answers collaborativly.
